## ABOUT 
This project came out of a afternoon where I was distracted in a connective, landscapy type of way and had an intense urge to remember it all. I wanted to materialise the moments for myself. The goal initially was to write an experimetal story but as usual the idea refused to contain a form and spread everywhere like water.
### the videos?
Taken on a s24 ultra, I just was thinking about things in them and considered editing into a cinematic thing but the medium felt inadequate for the moment.

### the cards?
Either thoughts I was thinking, things someone had recently said to me or things I was readings this october break


- made with an ultra strawberry dreams flavour, smugged eye makeup and a need to feel like myself again
